â€œFruit and Vegetable Classification using Transfer Learning"

This project focuses on the development of a robust fruit and vegetable classification system using
transfer learning, leveraging the MobileNetV2 architecture. MobileNetV2, known for its
efficiency in handling image recognition tasks on resource-constrained devices, is pre-trained on
the ImageNet dataset. By utilizing transfer learning, the model benefits from pre-learned features,
allowing it to accelerate the training process while maintaining high levels of accuracy. The
system's primary goal is to predict whether an uploaded image contains a fruit or vegetable, and
further identify the specific type from a wide range of categories. The dataset used for training
comprises a diverse set of food items, categorized into training, testing, and validation subsets.
MobileNetV2's lightweight nature makes it ideal for deployment in environments with limited
computational resources, such as mobile applications and edge devices. & also comparative
sequential and VGG16 Furthermore, the project integrates a user-friendly web interface developed
using Streamlit, enabling users to upload images for real-time classification. This web interface
can handle images from various sources, including photos taken from the internet or real-world
datasets, providing accurate and quick predictions. The application has significant potential in
industries such as smart grocery stores, where it could enhance checkout systems, automated food
quality inspection, and personalized dietary tracking systems by recognizing ingredients in meals.
This solution combines speed, efficiency, and accuracy, addressing the growing demand for
automated, real-time food item recognition across a range of sectors, from retail to healthcare and
agriculture
